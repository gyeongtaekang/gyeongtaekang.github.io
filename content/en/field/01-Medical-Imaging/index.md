**Map Creation for Branch Locations**  
A map-based system was built to provide a clear overview of branch locations on the site. The addresses and related information of each branch were collected and accurately displayed on the map, allowing users to easily find branches within a specific area. This enables customers to quickly locate the branch in their desired location.

**Marker Display and Detailed Information**  
Each branch on the map is represented by a marker, clearly indicating its location. When a marker is clicked, detailed information about the branch (such as branch name, address, business hours, contact information, etc.) is displayed. This intuitive design allows users to easily access branch information, providing effective information delivery through the map.

**Filtering Function**  
Since the site's branches are distributed nationwide, various filtering options were added to help users find branches that meet their specific conditions. Users can search branches by region, business hours, specific services offered, and other criteria. This functionality allows users to efficiently find their desired branch, enhancing the site's usability.

**Project Significance and Achievements**  
Through this project, the site was equipped with a map-based system that allows users to easily find the branch they want, and users were able to obtain branch information more efficiently. The filtering function greatly simplified the branch search process, significantly increasing the site's usefulness, and the intuitive display of branch information through markers improved the user experience.

Providing branch information through a map goes beyond simply showing locations; it makes the process of finding a desired branch much simpler and more convenient. This outsourcing project has greatly contributed to enhancing the value of the cigarette sales site and helping customers use the site more conveniently.
