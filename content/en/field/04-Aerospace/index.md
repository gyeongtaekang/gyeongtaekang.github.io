## Key Features and Characteristics of the App

**Location-based Matching**  
   The app uses the current location of the user to find nearby people who are willing to share delivery fees. This helps reduce the cost of delivery, allowing users to enjoy their food at a more affordable price.

**Real-time Matching System**  
   The app continuously updates the participation status of users in real time, sharing information about the menu to be ordered, the number of people involved, and the estimated delivery fee. This allows users to find others who match their preferences and share a delivery.

**Convenient Chatting Feature**  
   Matched users can use the in-app chat to discuss what food to order and decide how to share the delivery fee. This ensures smooth communication within the matched group and helps facilitate a seamless ordering process.

**Secure Payment System**  
   The app provides a secure payment feature for sharing the cost of food and delivery within the app. This allows users to safely and conveniently handle financial transactions with others, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

## Value and Usefulness of the App

The "Baedal Jjok" app offers an efficient way to share delivery costs for users who frequently order delivery food. It is particularly useful for single-person households, students, and office workers who are sensitive to delivery fees, enabling more people to enjoy food delivery at a reasonable price.

The development of this app not only helps users reduce their delivery fee burden but also creates a new experience through social matching, contributing to a new trend in food delivery culture.
