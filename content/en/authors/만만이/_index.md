bio: |
  It was the year 2014... Gyeongtae returned from school, only to find Manmani waiting in an angry state...  
  Trying to enter the house, I was confronted by Manmani, who raised its feathers and blocked my way...  
  Having no choice but to avoid a fight, I ran and safely entered the house away from Manmani.  
  (Truth be told, it's a secret that I ran away from Manmani.)
