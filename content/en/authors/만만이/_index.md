  ## Manmani's Story
  In 2011, Gyeongtae was returning home from school when Manmani was waiting angrily...  

  As I was trying to get into the house, Manmani was blocking me and raising its feathers...  

  I had no choice but to run away from Manmani and safely enter the house.  
  (Actually, it‚Äôs a secret that I ran away from Alpha Male Manmani, who raised me but doesn't appreciate it „Ö†)
