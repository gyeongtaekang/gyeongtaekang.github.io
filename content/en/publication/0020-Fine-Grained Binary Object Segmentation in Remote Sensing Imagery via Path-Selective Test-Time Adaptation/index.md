To apply, one needs to choose a major, prepare application documents, take entrance exams, and get ready for the interview. This article provides an overall guide to the application process to help prospective students successfully gain admission.

  **1. Choosing a Major and Preparation**  
  The first step is to choose a major that fits your interests and future research direction. It's essential to consider how it aligns with your undergraduate studies or future research plans. Since SNU's graduate school offers various majors, thorough research on areas of interest is recommended before making a decision.

  **2. Preparing Application Documents**  
  The required documents for application typically include a statement of purpose (SOP), study plan, letters of recommendation, and academic transcripts. As different majors may have specific requirements, it is crucial to carefully review the application guidelines. The SOP and study plan are particularly significant, as they showcase your academic capabilities and vision, so they should be prepared meticulously.

  **3. Entrance Exam and Selection Process**  
  Most majors at SNU require written exams and interviews as part of the entrance process. Applicants should check the selection process and exam subjects for their chosen major and prepare thoroughly. During the interview, you should be able to clearly articulate your research interests and study plan.

  **4. Preparing for the Interview**  
  The interview is an opportunity to directly communicate with faculty members. You need to clearly convey your research plan, motivation, and goals for graduate studies. Preparing for potential questions through mock interviews and regularly practicing presentation and discussion skills will be helpful.
