I would like to introduce one of the projects I have attempted. The Chonbuk National University Central Club CPU website development is an important project aimed at efficiently managing the activities of club members and facilitating the participation of new members. The site is planned to provide the following key features.

<br>
<!--more-->

**Login System**  
All users accessing the site are authenticated through a login system. Existing club members can log in with their accounts to check activities and announcements within the club, and new students who wish to join can sign up through a simple procedure to access the site. This ensures that all users can access content according to their permissions.

**Activity Details and Club Announcements**  
A clean design and well-organized bulletin board format are used so that various activities and announcements within the club can be seen at a glance. Here, you can find details about the club's schedule, event plans, study meetings, workshops, mentoring sessions, and more. It serves as a space where members can communicate. Additionally, detailed information and updates on each activity and schedule can be checked in real-time to facilitate smooth participation.

**Club Membership Application**  
Students interested in the club can easily apply for membership through the site. Applicants can submit a brief self-introduction and their motivation for applying, and the club will review these submissions and complete the membership through a simple approval process. This feature simplifies the previously complex offline application process, allowing many students to conveniently join the club.

**Project Significance**  
This site will provide an online platform that all current and prospective members of the central club CPU can conveniently and effectively use, supporting the activation and efficient management of club activities. Furthermore, by gathering all announcements and activity details in one place, it will encourage greater participation among existing members and actively promote new members' involvement in the club.
