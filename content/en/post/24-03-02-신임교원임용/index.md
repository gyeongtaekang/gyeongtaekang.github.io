The "Baedal Jjok" app is an application that offers a new delivery service experience, and during the hackathon, our team realized this idea, winning the Grand Prize. The app provides user-friendly features and was developed using various cutting-edge technologies. The team members were Geonwoo Kang and Gyeongtae Kang.

### Key Features and Tech Stack:

- **Google Maps API Integration**: To allow users to easily check the delivery route and find the optimal path, the Google Maps API was integrated. This enhanced the user experience, providing a visual representation of delivery times and routes.
- **KakaoTalk Login API**: The app implemented KakaoTalk's login API to support quick user login and registration. This increased user convenience and streamlined the authentication process.
- **Firebase and Google Cloud for Web Hosting**: Firebase was used for real-time database functions and user authentication management. Additionally, stable web hosting was achieved through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), ensuring the app's performance and reliability.
- **MySQL and Node.js**: The backend was built using a MySQL database for data management, while server-side logic was implemented using Node.js. This stack enabled fast data processing and stable server communication.
- **jQuery, Vanilla JS, and Bootstrap**: For frontend development, jQuery and Vanilla JavaScript were used to create a dynamic user interface. Bootstrap was applied to implement responsive design, ensuring a user-friendly experience across various devices.

The "Baedal Jjok" app successfully combined these diverse technologies to create a convenient delivery service, and it was the result of efficient collaboration and creative ideas throughout the development period. Winning the Grand Prize at the hackathon recognizes both the technical completeness and the innovative concept of the app, highlighting its great potential to present new possibilities in the delivery service industry.
