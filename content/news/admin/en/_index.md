    summary: |
      Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) helps manage code complexity by specifying relationships between functions and the objects they operate on. This intermediate-level course provided an introduction to OOP using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is useful for simplifying some functions in everyday R programming, while R6 is particularly useful for industry-specific analysis, web API work, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello, I am a student at Chonbuk National University, studying in the Department of Computer Science, and also an undergraduate researcher at the Macs Lab. Alongside my university studies, I‚Äôve attended a computer academy and done additional self-study. I have received awards at school hackathons and have worked as a freelance developer on ‚ÄúKmong‚Äù for two months. I can develop both apps and websites, and I specialize in frontend development. I work with React Native and Android Studio for app development.
